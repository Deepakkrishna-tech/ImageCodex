It's designed for artists, designers, and storytellers who want to maintain **creative continuity**‚Äîbridging the gap between a single visual idea and a full-fledged cinematic scene. Instead of just generating outputs, VisionFlow provides you with world-class, production-ready prompts to use in your favorite tools like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Runway, or Pika.

## ‚ú® Core Features

VisionFlow operates as a modular, two-stage workflow powered by a team of specialized AI agents:

### **Stage 1: Image ‚Üí Image Prompt (Prompt A)**
Upload any source image and the **VisualAnalystAgent** deconstructs its style, mood, and composition. Then, the **PromptEngineerAgent**, acting as a legendary prompt artist, synthesizes this analysis into a rich, evocative prompt perfect for generating new, high-fidelity images.

*   **Deep Visual Analysis**: Goes beyond keywords to understand artistic intent.
*   **Creative Prompt Synthesis**: Generates prompts that are more artistic and nuanced than simple descriptions.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: A built-in loop allows you to conversationally edit and perfect the prompt with the **RefinerAgent**.

### **Stage 2: Image ‚Üí Video Prompt (Prompt B)**
This is where the magic of creative continuity happens. You can either:
1.  Upload the image you generated with Prompt A.
2.  Upload any new image to start fresh.

The **VideoDirectorAgent** then steps in.
*   **Context-Aware Direction**: If you use the full workflow, the agent analyzes **both** the original source image and the new image to understand the creative evolution, producing a video prompt that honors the original artistic soul.
*   **AI Collaboration via Creative Brief**: Don't know how to describe camera movements? No problem. A guided "Creative Brief" lets you suggest moods and ideas, and the AI Director elevates them into professional cinematic language.

## üöÄ The Agentic Workflow

VisionFlow is built on a sophisticated, conditional graph using **LangGraph**. This allows for a flexible, multi-agent system where different AI specialists collaborate to bring your vision to life.

| Agent                 | Role                                                                        | Core Task                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **VisualAnalyst**     | A seasoned Art Director                                                     | Deconstructs an image into structured, artistic insights.   |
| **PromptEngineer**    | A legendary Prompt Artist                                                   | Synthesizes analysis into a masterful text-to-image prompt. |
| **VideoDirector**     | A visionary Film Director                                                   | Translates images and ideas into cinematic video direction. |
| **Refiner**           | A master Prompt Editor                                                      | Seamlessly integrates user feedback into any prompt.        |
